        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">

        <p className="mb-4">
          We are ex-operators who felt this pain firsthand while scaling e-commerce startups. Orange was born not as a tool,
          but as an answer to a broken process. Merchants shouldn‚Äôt need 4 dashboards, 3 analysts, and daily standups to
          know what competitors are doing.
        </p>

        </ul>
  
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg font-semibold">
